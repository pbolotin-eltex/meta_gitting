What if we will use Git for project with Git?

1. We can have different levels and approaches for history:
    1.1. Meta level, that can be high leveled, linear and
         has some of features of a squash-commiting approach.
    1.2. Under level, traditional git, with many branches and 
         detailed commits if we want those.

2. We can see how git works on meta level git using.
   That can give us new level of understanding of movement of project.
   And as well as it has great opportunity for learning git through meta level.
    
3. We can have more brave for a git experimentation
   trying different approaches.

P.S. Maybe it is just another stupid idea,
     but evolution can accept this branch
     for best results in the future, isn't?
